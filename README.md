Welcome to my ReactJS Apps repo !

This repo contains compilation of my projects using ReactJS. I believe the only way to be good at something is to practice doing it.
So, I studied & followed along ReactJS tutorials from multiple sources such as freeCodeCamp.org & Youtube, in order to get myself used to this powerful JavaScript library.

List of Projects (tutorial): 
1. Drum Machine (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBF6dFjb7p0)
2. Markdown Previewer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7Mrj0WrvnM&t=392s)
